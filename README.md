First of all, idk where this came from, but you need to calculate the step, originally i got this from
another fastboot bruteforce repo, but these `formula` still seems unknown to me, ill make it user input later
but now you need to replace `i += ...` where `...` your

square root of your imei divided by 14(???) and remove floating point

then replace it and compile your own, update will be soon
(i think)
