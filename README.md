clone if and run main.exe, if you are special little boy, edit sources and recompile your own
script, requirements to have a phone that not reloads every 5 tries(you can basically give up, it will take years)
and have `adb.exe`, `fastboot.exe`, and their dependecies is the same folder, have fun

also, im not cpp developer, im python little boy, if you see anything wrong - post pull request
