Hi, these script will bruteforce a fastboot for you, only thing you need is
clone if and run main.exe, if you are special little boy, edit sources and recompile your own
script, requirements to have a phone that not reloads every 5 tries(you can basically give up, it will take years)
and have `adb.exe`, `fastboot.exe`, and their dependecies is the same folder, have fun

also, im not cpp developer, im python little boy, if you see anything wrong - post pull request

todo:
add threads(will be op)

some things i found while making this:
if you will not reload fastboot rescue mode after another connection with script it will be very slow
rebooting phone and getting into fastboot mode makes it faster
